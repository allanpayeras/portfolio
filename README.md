# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio!

Each of the directories listed below contains a project. A short overview of the projects is presented here. Additionally, each of the directories contains its own `README` file with a more in-depth description.

* [`star_classification`](/star_classification/) : Data from the Hipparcos Astronomical Catalogue is utilized to train different classification models to categorize stars of our galaxy.

* [`summarize_pdf`](/summarize_pdf/) : A python script that summarizes academic papers using generative AI and produces an MP3 file so that the contents can be conveniently listened.
