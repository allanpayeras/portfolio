# Stellar classification using machine learning models

Stars fascinate humanity since its beginning. It has played a very important role in our history, providing us with a cosmic callendar which proved itself crucial for activities such as agriculture.

Modern science has made significant discoveries about the nature of these celestial bodies. We now know that stars are mainly made of different elements clustered toghether in a hot plasma fueled by nuclear fusion reactions.

Very important to understand the evolution of a star during its lifecyle is its classification in a system called *Yerkes Spectral Classification*, introduced by William W. Morgan, Philip C. Keenan and Edith Kellman of the Yerkes Observatory.

In this project, the application of machine learning models for classification of stars will be studied utilizing data from the *Hipparcos Astronomical Catalogue*.
